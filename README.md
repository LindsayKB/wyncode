## What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?

The convention for naming classes in CSS is hypen-delimited, meaning that each class name's words are separated by hypens. 

## What is one way to stop a form from submitting with JavaScript?

You can "return false" and/or call "e.preventDefault()". 

## When and how should HTML code be validated?

HTML should be validated during the debugging process. One way to validate HTML code is by inputting your code into https://validator.w3.org/. 

## What is the DOM? Please explain in your own words.

The DOM, which also stands for Document Object Model, and it's the interface that lets programs and scripts access and modify content. 

## Which one is better: CSS Grid, Flexbox or just plain CSS?

This is more of a personal preference, but I think Flexbox is the best CSS layout because it's automatically responsive, it lets the developer lay out content in any direction, and items can change their sizes to respond to the available space. 


## Install and Running

**NOTE!** Use the latest version of Node, 5.x.x.

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.

For the tests run npm test


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
